        by Skool or by Admin, all fees due to Admin up to the end of the
        then-current term renewal period at the time of cancellation shall
        remain payable to Admin. No refunds will be provided for partial billing
        periods, unless otherwise specifically stated in an applicable

        SUBSCRIPTION PAYMENTS AUTOMATICALLY RENEW FOR INDEFINITE SUCCESSIVE
        RENEWAL TERMS FOR THE SAME PERIOD AS THE INITIAL TERM, UNTIL CANCELED BY

        CLICKING &quot;CANCEL SUBSCRIPTION&quot; IN THE MEMBERSHIP TAB OF THE

        Subscription for the Admin&apos;s community before the free trial ends,

        further payments will be taken from the Member&apos;s payment card in
        respect of Subscriptions to that Admin&apos;s community (unless the
        Member chooses to pay for a new Subscription to that Admin&apos;s
        community), and the Member will no longer be able to view the relevant
        Admin&apos;s Content.
