        <Typography>
          <u>On-Time Payment.</u>
          Admin hereby authorizes Skool to charge Admin's payment method (as
          specified below), in advance, for the amount of Admin's regular
          subscription fees, inclusive of any and all Services that Admin has
          signed up for (collectively, “Subscription Fees”), for each agreed
          term of the Admin's selected subscription term. Admin hereby
          authorizes Skool to modify the Subscription Fees charged for a
          selected subscription term upon thirty (30) days’ notice to Admin sent
          by e-mail to the address provided on registration. The Subscription
          Fees, when paid, are non-refundable and accrue on the first day of
          each term or successive renewal term until canceled, regardless of
          whether or not the Admin actually uses the Site or the Services.
          Various Services on the Site, whether offered by Skool, third-party
          service providers or others, may require additional fees or charges
          not included within a subscription.
        </Typography>
        <Typography>
          Admin is required to pay all charges on time and agrees to submit an
          accompanying payment authorization in connection with these charges
          when requested by Skool. Skool may terminate or disable Admin's
          subscription if Admin fails to pay fully and in a timely manner all
          amounts due to Skool. If Admin's payment method expires or is
          otherwise declined for payment, access to the Services and the Site
          may be modified, suspended or cancelled, in Skool's sole discretion
          and without notice to Admin. All fees are quoted and payable in United
          States Dollars. Admin is also responsible for paying all applicable
          taxes for Services and/or Content, and any other costs incurred in
          connection with the use of or access to the Site or its Services.
        </Typography>
        <Typography>
          <u>Payment Methods.</u>
          Admin agrees to the{" "}
          <Link href="/legal?t=privacy">Privacy Policy</Link> when providing any
          necessary personal information for the purposes of processing payment
          for a Skool subscription. Skool may use third-party service providers
          for payment processing. In such cases, the third-party payment
          processor’s terms and conditions apply. Please review these
          third-party terms and conditions before completing payment.
        </Typography>
        <Typography>
          <u>Subscription Term; Auto Renewal.</u>
          Subscriptions are normally assessed on a monthly or annual basis, but
          other Services and their respective billing arrangements may be made
          available to Admins at Skool's sole discretion. The Subscription Fees
          are calculated from the day upon which Admin's paid Subscription
          commences. From time to time and at its sole discretion, Skool may
          offer different subscription terms on its Site, and the fees for such
          subscriptions may vary. The term of Admin's access to the Site,
          Services and Content is based upon Admin's express agreement and
          adherence to these Terms and to Admin's fully paid subscription and/or
          other fees.{" "}
          <b>
            Admin's subscription to the Site shall be for the initial term
            (e.g., monthly or annually) as may be agreed by Admin and Skool
            through online registration and shall automatically renew for
            indefinite successive renewal terms for the same period as the
            initial term, unless terminated by Admin or Skool in accordance with
            the provisions of these Terms.
          </b>
        </Typography>
        <Typography>
          <u>Cancellation.</u>
          Either Skool or Admin may cancel Admin’s Subscription at any time for
          any reason (unless otherwise stated in an applicable promotional
          offer). In the event of cancellation by Skool or by Admin, all fees
          due to Skool up to the end of the then-current term billing cycle at
          time of cancellation shall remain payable to Skool. No refunds will be
          provided for partial billing periods, unless otherwise specifically
          stated in an applicable promotional offer. Upon cancellation, Admin
          will retain access to Skool through the end of Admin’s billing period.
          After the end of such billing period, Admin’s group will be archived,
          whereas then-current content will be available on a read-only basis,
          and no new content may be added.
        </Typography>
        <Typography>
          Admins may cancel their subscription by any of the methods below:
        </Typography>
        <List>
          <ListItem>
            Sign into Admin’s Skool account, click on “Settings” and click on
            “Billing” then “Cancel Subscription”; or

          </ListItem>
        </List>
        <Typography>
          If at any time Skool believes, in its sole discretion, that an Admin
          has violated any provision of these Terms, Skool may immediately
          terminate that Admin’s Subscription and all other Services without any
          refund or other remedy, and all fees due to Skool up to the end of the
          then-current billing cycle at the time of such termination shall
          remain payable to Skool. Such termination will not limit any other
          right by Skool under contract, tort or any other legal theory to
          pursue any claim or cause of action against the Admin for violating
          these Terms, including without limitation, monetary damages,
          injunctive relief, attorney's fees and court costs.
        </Typography>
        <Typography>
          <u>Account Discrepancies.</u>
          Admin may contact Skool by e-mail at help@skool.com concerning charges
          or other questions regarding the status of Admin's account. However,
          if Admin's account-related questions are not satisfactorily resolved
          within fifteen (15) business days of Admin's first calling or sending
          an e-mail to Skool Support regarding such questions, Admin must write
          to Skool at: SKOOL.COM, Inc., 111 Main St. El Segundo, CA 90245,
          delivered by United States mail.
        </Typography>
        <Typography>
          Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event may Admin dispute any
          charge or account billing hereunder later than ninety (90) days after
          such questionable account billing or other discrepancy should have
          been or could have been reasonably discovered by Admin. Otherwise,
          except as required by applicable law, any and all such Admin
          complaints are waived by Admin.

            <u>Informal Resolution.</u>
            You and Skool agree that good-faith informal efforts to resolve
            disputes often can result in a prompt, low-cost and mutually
            beneficial outcome.You and Skool therefore agree that, before either
            you or Skool demands arbitration against the other, we will
            personally meet and confer, via telephone or video conference, in a
            good-faith effort to resolve informally any claim covered by this
            mutual Arbitration Agreement. If you are represented by counsel,
            your counsel may participate in the conference, but you shall also
            fully participate in the conference. The party initiating the claim
            must give notice to the other party in writing of its, his, or her
            intent to initiate an informal dispute resolution conference, which
            shall occur within 60 days after the other party receives such
            notice, unless an extension is mutually agreed upon by the parties.
            To notify Skool that you intend to initiate an informal dispute
            resolution conference, email help@skool.com, providing your username
            associated with your Skool account (if any), the email address
            associated with your Skool account (if any), and a description of
            your claim. In the interval between the party receiving such notice
            and the informal dispute resolution conference, the parties shall be
            free to attempt to resolve the initiating party’s claims. Engaging
            in an informal dispute resolution conference is a requirement that
            must be fulfilled before commencing arbitration. The statute of
            limitations and any filing fee deadlines shall be tolled while the
            parties engage in the informal dispute resolution process required
            by this paragraph.

            <u>Arbitration Rules and Forum.</u>
            This Arbitration Agreement is governed by the Federal Arbitration
            Act in all respects. To begin an arbitration proceeding, you must
            send a letter requesting arbitration and describing your claim to
            our registered agent, COGENCY GLOBAL, INC. 850 New Burton Rd, Suite
            201. Dover, DE19904. The arbitration will be conducted by JAMS under
            its rules and pursuant to the terms of this Agreement. Disputes
            involving claims and counterclaims under $250,000, not inclusive of
            attorneys’ fees and interest, shall be subject to JAMS’s most
            current version of the Streamlined Arbitration Rules and procedures
            available at
            <Link href="http://www.jamsadr.com/rules-streamlined-arbitration/">

            </Link>
            ; all other claims shall be subject to JAMS’s most current version
            of the Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures, available at{" "}
            <Link href="http://www.jamsadr.com/rules-comprehensive-arbitration/">
              http://www.jamsadr.com/rules-comprehensive-arbitration/

            . JAMS’s rules are also available at
            <Link href="www.jamsadr.com">www.jamsadr.com</Link>
            (under the Rules/Clauses tab) or by calling JAMS at 800-352-5267.
            Payment of all filing, administration, and arbitration fees will be
            governed by JAMS’s rules. If the arbitrator finds that you cannot
            afford to pay JAMS’s filing, administrative, hearing and/or other
            fees and cannot obtain a waiver of fees from JAMS, we will pay them
            for you. In addition, we will reimburse all such JAMS’s filing,
            administrative, hearing and/or other fees for claims with an amount
            in controversy totaling less than $10,000. If JAMS is not available
            to arbitrate, the parties will select an alternative arbitral forum.
            You may choose to have the arbitration conducted by telephone, video
            conference, based on written submissions, or in person in the county
            where you live or at another mutually agreed location.

            <u>Arbitrator Powers.</u>
            The arbitrator, and not any federal, state, or local court or
            agency, shall have exclusive authority to resolve any dispute
            relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability or
            formation of this Arbitration Agreement including, but not limited
            to any claim that all or any part of this Arbitration Agreement is
            void or voidable. The arbitration will decide the rights and
            liabilities, if any, of you and Skool. The arbitration proceeding
            will not be consolidated with any other matters or joined with any
            other proceedings or parties. The arbitrator will have the authority
            to grant motions dispositive of all or part of any claim or dispute.
            The arbitrator will have the authority to award monetary damages and
            to grant any non-monetary remedy or relief available to an
            individual under applicable law, the arbitral forum’s rules, and
            this Agreement (including this Arbitration Agreement). The
            arbitrator will issue a written statement of decision describing the
            essential findings and conclusions on which any award (or decision
            not to render an award) is based, including the calculation of any
            damages awarded. The arbitrator shall follow the applicable law. The
            arbitrator has the same authority to award relief on an individual
            basis that a judge in a court of law would have. The arbitrator’s
            decision is final and binding on you and Skool.

            <u>Waiver of Jury Trial.</u>
            YOU AND SKOOL WAIVE ANY CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO SUE
            IN COURT AND RECEIVE A JUDGE OR JURY TRIAL. You and Skool are
            instead electing to have claims and disputes resolved by
            arbitration, except as specified in Section 16(a) above. There is no
            judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration
            award is limited.

          <ListItem>
            <u>Waiver of Class or Consolidated Actions.</u>
            YOU AND SKOOL AGREE TO WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO RESOLVE CLAIMS WITHIN THE
            SCOPE OF THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT ON A CLASS, COLLECTIVE, OR
            REPRESENTATIVE BASIS. ALL CLAIMS AND DISPUTES WITHIN THE SCOPE OF
            THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT MUST BE ARBITRATED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS
            AND NOT ON A CLASS BASIS. CLAIMS OF MORE THAN ONE CUSTOMER OR USER
            CANNOT BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED JOINTLY OR CONSOLIDATED WITH THOSE
            OF ANY OTHER CUSTOMER OR USER. If, however, this waiver of class or
            consolidated actions is deemed invalid or unenforceable with respect
            to a particular claim or dispute, neither you nor Skool is entitled
            to arbitration of such claim or dispute. Instead, all such claims
            and disputes will then be resolved in a court as set forth in
            Section 17.

            <u>Batch Arbitrations.</u>
            To increase efficiency of resolution, in the event 100 or more
            similar arbitration demands against Skool, presented by or with the
            assistance of the same law firm or organization, are submitted to an
            arbitration provider selected in accordance with the rules described
            above within a 30-day period, the arbitration provider shall (i)
            group the arbitration demands into batches of no more than 100
            demands per batch (plus, to the extent there are less than 100
            arbitration demands left over after the batching described above, a
            final batch consisting of the remaining demands); and (ii) provide
            for resolution of each batch as a single arbitration with one set of
            filing and administrative fees and one arbitrator assigned per
            batch. You agree to cooperate in good faith with Skool and the
            arbitration provider to implement such a batch approach to
            resolution and fees.
